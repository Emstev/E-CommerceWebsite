# 🚀 E-commerce Website CI/CD Deployment on AWS

This project demonstrates a complete CI/CD workflow to deploy an **E-commerce website** on AWS using **Jenkins**, **Terraform**, **Docker**, and **GitHub**. It leverages **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** and container orchestration to ensure fast, scalable, and reliable application delivery.


## 🧰 Tech Stack & Tools

- **Terraform** – Infrastructure provisioning
- **Jenkins** – CI/CD automation
- **Docker** – Application containerization
- **GitHub** – Source control & webhook integration
  
- **AWS Services**:
  - **Amazon ECS** – Container orchestration
  - **Amazon ECR** – Docker image storage
  - **Application Load Balancer** – Traffic distribution
  - **Amazon S3** – Terraform state storage
  - **Amazon DynamoDB** – State locking for Terraform


## 🧱 Project Architecture

    GitHub--Push Code-->Jenkins
    Jenkins--Trigger Build-->Docker
    Docker--Build Image-->ECR
    Jenkins--Run Terraform-->AWS
    Terraform--Provision-->ECS
    ECS--Deploy-->ALB
    ALB--Serve-->Users


🪜 Step-by-Step Workflow

Provision Jenkins Server
Set up an EC2 instance and install Jenkins to handle build automation.

Manual Terraform Deployment
Configure main.tf to provision S3 (for remote backend) and DynamoDB (for state locking).
Run Terraform manually to set up infrastructure.

Create Jenkins Pipeline Job
Define a pipeline job using a Jenkinsfile that includes build, push, and deploy stages.

Build and Deploy via Jenkinsfile
Jenkins builds the Docker image and pushes it to Amazon ECR.
Terraform is triggered to deploy the image to ECS behind an Application Load Balancer.

Test Website
Access the deployed E-commerce site through the DNS name generated by the ALB.

Set up GitHub Webhook
Webhook integration to trigger Jenkins builds on every push to the main branch.

Test Automated CI/CD
Make code changes and push to GitHub to verify end-to-end CI/CD automation.
